# Velaris: City of Starlight

I am selecting the topic of Velaris because I **love** the ACOTAR (*A Court of Thorns and Roses*) series. It was difficult for me to figure out a topic so I went with something I am interested in. I love to read and ACOTAR, **specifically** *A Court of Mist and Fury* where Velaris is introduced, is in my **top 5** favorite books. With the help of chatGPT I intend to create a webpage that will make Velaris feel like a real place.

## General Description

I used the * selector to reset margins, padding, and box sizing. the body includes a font family, background color, and font size, and is set to flex display in a column direction for a flexible layout. the header, nav, main, and footer all have padding for space, and are set to flex display in a column.i also used justify-content: center. the header contains a logo and title. it has a font, backgound color, and text color. the menu is displayed as an unordered list because its more aesthetically pleasing than a numbered or bullet point list to me. i also used hover and visited effects. i have chosen common media query breakpoints. i went with small, medium, large, and x-large because when i tried xx-large it looked too big on my laptop.
