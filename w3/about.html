    <h3>What I Think of Using chatGPT for Research</h3>

    <p>I have never used chatGPT before this assignment. I don't know if I like it. I used the prompt to learn about online book clubs so I could create this web page but I dont know if I choose the right topic for something like this. My webpage seems kind of boring. It gave me a full essay I could have copies and pasted. Maybe I should try to experiment with it more but as of right now it wasn't as helpful as if I would've just done my own research.</p>
